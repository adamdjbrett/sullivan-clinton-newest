<strong>SULLIVAN-CLINTON</strong> is an <em>essential</em> journey. It's not for the faint of heart, nor the stubborn of mind. It's a major event in U.S. history that's been way off the radar screen for far too long. More road signs than any NY event, yet not in our school books. But just as America undergoes historic changes, the lessons of Sullivan/ Clinton are more relevant than ever. Come learn - <em>at your own pace</em>. Do your research here. Then come back again for more, as we <em>continually</em> update this living website...<br />
