The instinct of antipathy against an Indian grows in the backwoodsman with the sense of good and bad, right and wrong. In one breath he learns that a brother is to be loved, and an Indian to be hated.

Herman Melville
(Grandson of Gen. Peter Gansevoort of S/C)
On "The Metaphysics of Indian Hating"
from The Confidence Man (1857)
