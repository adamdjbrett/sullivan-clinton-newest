When your army entered the country of the Six Nations, we called you **Town Destroyer**: and to this day when that name is heard our women look behind them and turn pale, and our children cling close to the necks of their mothers. Our counsellors and warriors are men, and cannot be afraid; but their hearts are grieved with the fears of our women and children, and desire that it may be buried so deep as to be heard no more.

Seneca Chief Cornplanter
To George Washington
1790
