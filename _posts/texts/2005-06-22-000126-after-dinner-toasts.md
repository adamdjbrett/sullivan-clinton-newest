General Washington and the Army;
General Sullivan & Western Expedition;
 King and Queen of France;
A Successful and Decisive Campaign;
May the new World be the last Asylum for Freedom and the Arts;
Civilization or death to all American Savages;
May the husbandman's Cottage be blest with peace and his fields with plenty.

Journal of Major James Norris
Wyoming Valley, Pennsylvania
