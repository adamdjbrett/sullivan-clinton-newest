The Three Sisters - Corn, Beans and Squash - are the traditional core of Seneca survival and worldview. Today, the Seneca Foods plant in the area at Leicester, NY processes beets, butter beans, carrots, corn, dry beans, mixed garden vegetables, peas, potatoes and stew vegetables. The Seneca Foods Corporation website proclaims:

"A Seneca produced canned vegetable product is in one out of every four cupboards in America!"
